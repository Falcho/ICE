Once unconscious you must make a Physical RR each round until you either fail (and die) or are healed enough hits to be above this threshold. While frenzied, you get no Defensive Bonus other than that due to magic and are unable to allocate OB to parry attacks. Furthermore, you will always attack the closest creature (medium Perception roll required to distinguish friend from foe) and an Adrenal Focus maneuver is required to exit the frenzied rage.
