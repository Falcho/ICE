    "description": "When a city gets large enough, those who dwell in it cease to be merely urban in culture. Large cities tend to have very finely specialized craftsmen, and the majority of their economy is devoted to trade and commerce. The combination of specialization, access to resources and cultural experiences you only find in large urban areas, and exposure to other people via trade and travel create a culture that is cosmopolitan.",
